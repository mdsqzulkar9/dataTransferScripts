% This is the master script for Throughput optimization by
% Cubic spline interpolation of data and fine tuned online 
% tuning by identifying the appropriate sampling region.

% The summary of the approach:
    % (1) Add all data into matlab. 
    
    % (2) perform cubic spline interpolation
    
    % (3) Use bitonic search to find max.
    
    % (4) Perform $ max min (th_{i} - th_{j})^{2} $  
    
    % (5) Identify the region from where we sample
    
    % (6) Perform baseline approach : nearest neighbor to predict {params}.
